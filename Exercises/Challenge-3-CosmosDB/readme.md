# Challenge 3 - Receive the events from EventGrid and store the data inside a Cosmos DB

In this challenge, you will upgrade the solution to *store the weather data* in a Cosmos DB. You will also create a function that *exposes the historical data* using HTTP:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge

* Provision Azure CosmosDb
* Create an Azure Function with an Event Grid binding
* Subscribe to the EventGrid topic
* Create an HTTP triggered Function to retrieve weather history data

## üí° Success Criteria

You have a **function** in place that gets triggered for each new Event Grid event and stores the payload (weather data) into a Cosmos DB. You will also need another function that returns all collected weather data and exposes it using HTTP.

This is how your challenge 3 resources should look like:
